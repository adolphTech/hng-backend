## Introduction

Welcome to the Person API project! This project aims to create a simple and versatile REST API capable of performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a "person" resource. The API can interact with any MONGO database, providing flexibility in your development stack. To ensure robustness and security, the API dynamically handles parameters, allowing actions like adding or retrieving a person by ID].
